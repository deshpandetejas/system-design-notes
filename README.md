# System Design Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on **system design and distributed systems**, written from an **engineering leadership perspective**.

These notes are not implementation guides or interview prep.
They focus on:
- trade-offs
- decision-making
- failure modes
- scalability and reliability concerns
that engineering leaders deal with as systems and teams grow.

## Why this repository

As I’ve moved from hands-on roles into engineering leadership, I’ve found that staying technically relevant is less about writing code daily and more about:
- understanding system behavior at scale
- asking the right questions in design reviews
- identifying risks early
- making clear, reversible decisions

This repo is a place to document that thinking.

## How to read these notes

Each note generally covers:
- the problem being solved
- core concepts
- trade-offs involved
- questions to ask during design discussions
- personal takeaways from a leadership point of view

They are intentionally concise and opinionated.

## Topics covered (growing over time)

- Scalability fundamentals
- Caching strategies
- CAP theorem (practical view)
- Event-driven architectures
- Reliability patterns (timeouts, retries, idempotency)
- Rate limiting and backpressure
- Failure modes in distributed systems

## Disclaimer

These notes reflect my understanding at a point in time.
They are meant to evolve as I learn, discuss, and get feedback.
